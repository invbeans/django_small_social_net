__This is version without that weird mistake i couldn't correct__
old version is in branch "moving" and it includes that problem i guess. don't clone it pls, exept if you want to catch bugs :>

<img alt="GitHub last commit (branch)" src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/invbeans/django_small_social_net/master?color=9cf&style=flat-square">

right now my plans: understand how to clean old like-reaction records, (would take long) comments block, validation of inputted info, block list and private accounts, (probably next) add profile pics. lets code 'odnoclassniki' great again

done:
1) custom user urls. it covers every page linked to user
2) validation of user's urls
3) likes button (but not storing problems)

how to start it: 
1) in your cmd go to ".../example"
2) print "manage.py runserver"
3) go to "localhost:8000/newsite/" in your brawser

problems:
1) javascript is passive agressive to me......
