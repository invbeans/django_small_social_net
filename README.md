right now my plans: likes button, custom user page url (dont really know how to do it in urls.py tho...), maybe comments block and validation of inputted info. lets code 'odnoclassniki' great again

how to start it: 
1) in your cmd go to ".../example"
2) print "manage.py runserver"
3) go to "localhost:8000/regform/" in your brawser
