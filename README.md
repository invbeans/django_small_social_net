__This is version without that weird mistake i couldn't correct__
old version is in branch "moving" and it includes that problem i guess. don't clone it pls, exept if you want to catch bugs :>

right now my plans: likes button, (one day) comments block, validation of inputted info, block list and private accounts. hopefully i'll manage to add profile pics after all this. lets code 'odnoclassniki' great again

done:
1) custom user urls. it covers every page linked to user
2) validation of user's urls

how to start it: 
1) in your cmd go to ".../example"
2) print "manage.py runserver"
3) go to "localhost:8000/newsite/" in your brawser

problems:
1) javascript is passive agressive to me......
